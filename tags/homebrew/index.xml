      <description>This week, the homebrewing community lost a prominent member. Paul Wicksteed, know by a lot of people as Time4Another1 passed away. Paul&amp;rsquo;s passing has been very shocking for all of us. My thoughts and prayers go out to Paul&amp;rsquo;s family and friends. The wounds will heal, even if they never go away. I hope wherever Paul is, the beer is some of the best he&amp;rsquo;s ever had. Rest in Peace friend, for now, it&amp;rsquo;s Time4Another1 in your honor.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s Wednesday, and that means, Home Brew Wednesday! In this HBW episode, I talk about my latest (as of yet un-named) beer, the Vanilla Java Stout, as well as a couple of the things that didn&amp;#8217;t go entirely right with brewing this time around. Hold on to your shoelaces, it&amp;#8217;s HBW for April 15th. Cheers!

      <description>In this episode of HBW, I talk about my latest beer, and try out a Pumpkin Spice Milk Stout from Belching Beaver Brewery. My current homebrew seems to be stuck at 1.022, which seems pretty high. It started out at 1.069 which would make it 6.17% if my calculations were stop on. I&amp;#8217;ve just never had a beer finish that high. I may just keg it and see how it goes, it doesn&amp;#8217;t taste overly sweet or anything.</description>
