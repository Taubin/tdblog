      <description>Blog changes I&amp;rsquo;m making some changes to the blog, and moving it from wordpress to Hugo. There are many techinical reasons for this, which I will get to on my personal blog
In the meantime, I need to change the posts so they are able to be posted properly in markdown format.
The old posts and pages will be back, I promise. I will get them up as soon as I can, in the meantime if you have any questions or are looking for any of the old recipes, please email me at taubin at taubindrinks.</description>

      <description>This week, the homebrewing community lost a prominent member. Paul Wicksteed, know by a lot of people as Time4Another1 passed away. Paul&amp;rsquo;s passing has been very shocking for all of us. My thoughts and prayers go out to Paul&amp;rsquo;s family and friends. The wounds will heal, even if they never go away. I hope wherever Paul is, the beer is some of the best he&amp;rsquo;s ever had. Rest in Peace friend, for now, it&amp;rsquo;s Time4Another1 in your honor.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s Wednesday, and that means, Home Brew Wednesday! In this HBW episode, I talk about my latest (as of yet un-named) beer, the Vanilla Java Stout, as well as a couple of the things that didn&amp;#8217;t go entirely right with brewing this time around. Hold on to your shoelaces, it&amp;#8217;s HBW for April 15th. Cheers!
